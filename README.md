## 🔎 Project Overview
In this project, I worked with a Retail Sales dataset to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main objective was to uncover patterns, trends, and business insights that can help a retail company make informed decisions. Instead of focusing on raw numbers alone, I applied statistical methods and visualizations to explore the data from multiple angles, turning it into actionable insights. This task enhanced my skills in data preparation, descriptive analytics, and visualization-driven storytelling.

## ✅ Key Steps Performed
### 📂 Dataset Preparation & Cleaning
- Imported the dataset using Pandas.
- Cleaned data by checking for missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- Converted dates into a usable time format for time-series analysis.
### 📊 Statistical & Analytical Exploration
- Calculated mean, median, mode, and standard deviation for key numerical features.
- Generated summary statistics for customer age, quantity, and sales.
- Performed time-series analysis to identify monthly and seasonal sales patterns.
## 📈 Visual Explorations & Insights
- I created a variety of visualizations to uncover business trends:
- Line Chart (Monthly Sales Trend) → Revealed peaks, seasonal spikes, and low-performing months.
- Bar Chart (Sales by Product Category) → Showed which categories drove the highest revenue.
- Histogram (Age Distribution of Customers) → Provided demographic insights into customer base.
- Gender Distribution Plot → Compared purchasing behavior of male vs female customers.
- Heatmap (Category vs Gender Sales) → Illustrated cross-segment revenue contribution.

## 📌 Business Insights Discovered:
- Sales Growth Trend → Significant variation across months highlighted seasonal opportunities.
- Top Categories → Certain categories consistently generated more revenue than others.
- Customer Demographics → Majority of sales came from young and middle-aged customers.
- Gender Insights → Both male and female customers contributed strongly, with category preferences varying.
- Revenue Drivers → Correlation between quantity and total amount highlighted key purchasing behavior.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used:
### The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
- Python (Jupyter Notebook) → For coding, analysis, and visualization.
- Pandas & NumPy → Data wrangling, cleaning, and calculations.
- Matplotlib & Seaborn → For creating professional plots and charts.
- Stats & Aggregations → Descriptive statistics and trend analysis.
